This library exposes the [Logi Circle](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/circle-2-home-security-camera) family of cameras as Python objects, wrapping Logi Circle's official API.

[Now available as a Home Assistant integration!](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/logi_circle/) :tada:

There are two versions of this API:

- `2.x` - which targets the public API ([`master` branch](https://github.com/evanjd/python-logi-circle/tree/master))
- [`1.x`](https://github.com/evanjd/python-logi-circle/tree/private-api) - which targets the private API **(you are here)**

## Installation

#### Installing release version

```bash
$ pip install -Iv logi-circle==0.1.9
```

#### Installing development master

    git+https://github.com/evanjd/python-logi-circle
```

## Usage example

#### Setup and authenticate:

```python
import asyncio
from logi_circle import Logi

logi_api = Logi('my@email.com', 'my-password')
```

#### Grab latest still image for each camera:

```python
async def get_snapshot_images():
    for camera in await logi_api.cameras:
        await camera.get_snapshot_image('%s.jpg' % (camera.name))
    await logi_api.logout()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(get_snapshot_images())
loop.close()
```

#### Download latest activity for all cameras:

```python
async def get_latest_activity():
    for camera in await logi_api.cameras:
        last_activity = await camera.last_activity
        await last_activity.download('%s-last-activity.mp4' % (camera.name))
    await logi_api.logout()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(get_latest_activity())
loop.close()
```

#### Stream live stream data to disk:

```python
async def get_livestream():
    camera = (await logi_api.cameras)[0]
    filename = '%s-livestream.mp4' % (camera.name)

    # Grab 1 minute of footage from live stream
    await camera.record_livestream(filename=filename, duration=timedelta(minutes=1))

    await logi_api.logout()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(get_livestream())
loop.close()
```

#### Download last 24 hours activity for the 1st camera (limited to 100, 5 at a time):

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Don't go nuts with parallelising downloads, you'll probably hit rate limits.
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(5)

async def download(camera, activity):
    async with semaphore:
        file_name = '%s - %s.mp4' % (camera.name,
                                     activity.start_time.isoformat())
        await activity.download(file_name)

async def run():
    my_camera = (await logi_api.cameras)[0]
    activities = await my_camera.query_activity_history(date_filter=datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=24), date_operator='>', limit=100)
    tasks = []

    for activity in activities:
        task = asyncio.ensure_future(download(my_camera, activity))
        tasks.append(task)

    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    logi_api.logout()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
future = asyncio.ensure_future(run())
loop.run_until_complete(future)
```

#### Turn off streaming for all cameras

```python
async def disable_streaming_all():
    for camera in await logi_api.cameras:
        if camera.streaming_mode is True:
            await camera.set_streaming_mode(False)
            print('%s is now off.' % (camera.name))
        else:
            print('%s is already off.' % (camera.name))
    await logi_api.logout()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(disable_streaming_all())
loop.close()
```

#### Play with camera properties

```python
async def play_with_props():
    for camera in await logi_api.cameras:
        last_activity = await camera.last_activity
        print('%s: %s' % (camera.name,
                          ('is charging' if camera.is_charging else 'is not charging')))
        print('%s: %s%% battery remaining' %
              (camera.name, camera.battery_level))
        print('%s: Battery saving mode is %s' %
              (camera.name, 'on' if camera.battery_saving else 'off'))
        print('%s: Model number is %s' % (camera.name, camera.model))
        print('%s: Model generation is %s' % (camera.name, camera.model_generation))
        print('%s: Mount is %s' % (camera.name, camera.mount))
        print('%s: Signal strength is %s%% (%s)' % (
            camera.name, camera.signal_strength_percentage, camera.signal_strength_category))
        print('%s: last activity was at %s and lasted for %s seconds.' % (
            camera.name, last_activity.start_time.isoformat(), last_activity.duration.total_seconds()))
        print('%s: Firmware version %s' % (camera.name, camera.firmware))
        print('%s: IP address is %s' % (camera.name, camera.ip_address))
        print('%s: MAC address is %s' % (camera.name, camera.mac_address))
        print('%s: Microphone is %s and gain is set to %s (out of 100)' % (
            camera.name, 'on' if camera.microphone_on else 'off', camera.microphone_gain))
        print('%s: Speaker is %s and volume is set to %s (out of 100)' % (
            camera.name, 'on' if camera.speaker_on else 'off', camera.speaker_volume))
        print('%s: LED is %s' % (
            camera.name, 'on' if camera.led_on else 'off'))
        print('%s: Privacy mode is %s' % (
            camera.name, 'on' if camera.privacy_mode else 'off'))
        print('%s: Subscribed to plan %s' % (
            camera.name, camera.plan_name))
    await logi_api.logout()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(play_with_props())
loop.close()
```

## Thanks

- This API borrows a lot of design and some utility functions from [tchellomello's](https://github.com/tchellomello) [Python Ring Doorbell](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-ring-doorbell) project. Our projects are doing similar things with similar devices and I really appreciated how simple and readable python-ring-doorbell is.
- Thanks [sergeymaysak](https://github.com/sergeymaysak) for suggesting a switch to aiohttp and for a tip to make downloading snapshot images more reliable.

## Contributing

They're very welcome, every little bit helps! I'm especially keen for help supporting devices that I do not own and cannot test with (eg. Circle 2 wired and wireless cameras).
